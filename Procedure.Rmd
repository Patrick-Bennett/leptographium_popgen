> Pseudocode: For each of the lane1|lane2 fastq, paste the command (cp), the source and the destination

```bash
bash
for i in /nfs2/hts/illumina/190410_J00107_0201_AH3VJGBBXY_1461/L125678/lane[12]*; do a=$(readlink -f $i); b=$(basename $i); printf "cp "$a" ""/nfs1/BPP/LeBoldus_Lab/lab_data/leptographium_reads/"$b"\n"; done > move_files.sh
